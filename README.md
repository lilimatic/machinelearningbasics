# machine learning basics
Information about the codes:
1. All codes are composed in R
2. All codes either include synthetically created data or data that is within a package. 
3. Theoretical simulations are provided for MLE, KDE, LOGIT, BAYES,OVERFITTING, CV and HOLD.

All required packages installation is provided by the code: `if(!require("")) install.packages(""); library("")`


Empirical examples:
The empirical examples are credit scoring with a logit model and binary classification with the famous IRIS data set. 

Remarks:
The code for KNN was inspired by
http://enhancedatascience.com/2018/05/23/create-your-machine-learning-library-from-scratch-with-r-3-5-knn/
-However, it was partly modified for efficiency reasons

The codes for model validation are inspired by:

-although only modified up to a constant, the code is fully explained by me
-serves a an interpretation and graphical illustration of theory.

Any code is accessible through the PDF file.
